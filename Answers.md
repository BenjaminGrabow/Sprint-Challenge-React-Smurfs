1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server-Side Routing
Request information from a server -> server sends back document that was requested. We click on a link -> URL changes to match the request ->  server goes and finds a template or some html file and sends it back across the world wide web to deliver that content to the user.
server refresh the site we are looking at because of new request was made for information and the information given was a bunch of DOM elements, we have to re-paint the web page. Only requested information will be given -> fast loading .
negative to this, is when we have a lot of information being requested. Process has to run through a lot of protocols -> slow loading.

Client-Side Routing
 modern routing: One of new patterns is using JavaScript to maintain State or memory within our applications and use that memory to tell the Browser what to display when a resource is requested.
When Routing is handled internally by the JavaScript that is already on the page we achieve what is known as Client-side routing . Positive effect: page wonâ€™t refresh! The data is just there, displayed when we ask for it. When user clicks on a requested resource ->  get the resource (state) that is already available to us rendered out and when using react, this happens through Component-Based Architecture.
